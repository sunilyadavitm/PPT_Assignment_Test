****Q1.What is the Spring MVC framework?****

Ans. The Spring MVC framework is a popular web application framework that is part of the Spring Framework.
It provides a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and components for building flexible and loosely coupled web applications.

Spring MVC is built on top of the Spring Framework's core features, such as dependency injection and inversion of control, 
which makes it easy to integrate with other Spring modules and technologies. 
It provides a powerful and flexible foundation for building web applications, with support for features such as data binding, validation, internationalization, and more.

The Spring MVC framework is highly configurable and extensible, allowing you to customize its behavior to meet the needs of your application.
It also provides a rich set of tools and libraries for building web applications, including support for RESTful web services, JSON and XML serialization, and more.




****Q2.What are the benefits of Spring MVC framework over other MVC frameworks?****

Ans. The string constant pool is a special memory area in the heap where the JVM stores string literals. 
When a string literal is created, the JVM checks if an identical string already exists in the pool. If it does, the JVM returns a reference to the existing string. 
If not, the JVM creates a new string object in the pool and returns a reference to it.

The string constant pool is part of the heap memory, which is used for dynamic memory allocation and stores objects at runtime. 
The heap allows global access to data, meaning that data stored in the heap is available to all threads during the lifetime of the application.


****Q3.What is DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC? In other words, can you explain the Spring MVC architecture?****

Ans. The DispatcherServlet is highly configurable and supports a wide range of features, such as view resolution, locale and theme resolution, file uploading, and more. 
It provides a flexible and powerful foundation for building web applications with Spring MVC

In the Spring MVC architecture, the DispatcherServlet plays a central role.
It receives incoming requests and uses configurable handler mappings to determine which handler should process the request. 
The handler, typically a controller, processes the request and returns a ModelAndView object that contains the model data and the name of the view to be rendered. 
The DispatcherServlet then uses a view resolver to determine the appropriate view to render the response

****Q4.What is a View Resolver pattern and explain its significance in Spring MVC?****
